message: "Yes, you need to compile the program in this form in Delphi. But it was written in Borland Pascal, and \"ported\" to Delphi only because of the limitations of 16-bit Borland Pascal 7.0.


P.S. If you need the source of the maximum flow, then you must imagine what it is. I do not see the point of doing a GUI for it - so that by stepping through debugging and understanding the meaning of the lines to your hands :))


And about the comments - all that I have I laid out. I wrote the source code for the pseudocode from Corman - he will help you figure it out."
