  rt2, you can use drawing backend (OpenGL for example) to draw something on the
  scene. The article is not about that, but about Nuklear. I do not feel myself
  advanced enough to write an OpenGL tutorial. But you can google ones. Your
  OpenGL code will be somewhere nearby clearing the scene with the color.
