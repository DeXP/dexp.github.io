My name is Dmitry Hrabrov. I'm a programmer since 2004.

I started my IT education at [Gomel state regional liceum](http://gsrl.by/) with specializing in mathematics and informatics, Olympiad programming. There was algorithmic times. I also started to write first [tools]({{ site.url }}/tools/) this time. Main language was Pascal (both Turbo and Free) and Delphi.

2006-2012 is my [University](https://www.gstu.by/) studies time. There was lot fun times and technologies: operation systems (Linux, Windows), command line, multi-threading, C/C++, C#, Lisp, Prolog. Also it was time for first commercial [websites]({{ site.url }}/sites/). So web-technologies: PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Prototype.js, memcached, XML, XSLT, C++/CGI.

Post-graduate studies was in 2012-2016. At this times I started my beloved [gamedev career]({{ site.url }}/games/). It started with [One Manga Day]({{ site.url }}/games/onemangaday/): RenPy (Python), Manga Maker Comipo, Magix Music Maker. [Winter Novel]({{ site.url }}/games/winternovel/) and [Wordlase]({{ site.url }}/games/wordlase/) made in C, OpenGL, WinAPI/SDL.

Also it was time for hardware development: C (Pic-controllers), VHDL (Xilinx), Flash memory, pseudo-random sequences generators.


### Main skills

I use Linux as my main operation system for 10 years. I prefer to write not platform-specific but crossplatform applications. 

My main programming language is C. I totally love it more than 10 years. For GUI applications I prefer C++ language with Qt framework.

For web applications I prefer PHP for dynamic applications, and Jekyll for static websites.
