Main window is pretty simple: you choose only *.Doc-file as database.

![ATest main window]({{ site.urlimg }}other/atest/atest_main.jpg "ATest main window"){: .center }


The main working window is a test settings. You can customize: title, instructions, decoration, count parameters, choose section and subsection.

![ATest current test settings]({{ site.urlimg }}other/atest/atest_set.jpg "ATest current test settings"){: .center }


The instaruction can be pretty compicated. So user have ability to edit it in standalone window.

![ATest main window]({{ site.urlimg }}other/atest/atest_instr.jpg "ATest main window"){: .center }


You can see the results in the "Compiled test" window. The result is a Microsoft Word document too.

![ATest main window]({{ site.urlimg }}other/atest/atest_ready.jpg "ATest main window")
