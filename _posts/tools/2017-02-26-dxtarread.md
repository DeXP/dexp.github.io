- single file with one function for each format (tar, ar, binary cpio)
- less than 50 lines of code, including comments, license and blanks
- or one file for all formats - more complicated, but more powerful
- easy to use, just returns a pointer to your file inside archive
- no dependencies (even stdlibc not used), embedded friendly
- requires no memory/malloc or copying, uses only what is passed in
- optimized for high speed routing of small archive files, stops parsing upon match
- designed to work in pair with tinfl.c from miniz
