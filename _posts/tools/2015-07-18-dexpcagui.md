> Cellular automata provide simple discrete deterministic mathematical models for physical, biological and computational systems. An "elementary" cellular automaton consists of a sequence of sites carrying values 0 or 1 arranged on a line. The value at each site evolves deterministically with time according to a set of definite rules involving the values of its nearest neighbours. 


"Vector" tab indicates a mathematical basis of cellular automata, where the calculation process is shown. There you can see the auxiliary matrix, rules vector conversion, verification of the polynomial for irreducibility.

"Heur.Brute" tab will help you find the correct rules vectors, such that generators can produce the maximum length sequence.

"Modelling" tab can simulate the functioning of a cellular automata.

You can generate VHDL or C/C++ code of cellular automata on the "Schematic" tab. Also you can see general view of your automata.
