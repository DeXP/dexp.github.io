subheadline: "Outlive the apocalypse"
title:  "VIGOR"
teaser: "Vigor is a free-to-play looter shooter set in post-war Norway.

The goal is to stay alive and upgrade an abandoned shelter that will protect the player against the harsh environment. Players called Outlanders, have to seek resources and better equipment during Encounters with other players. Every Encounter has a map that shows players all the exit points, as well as Points of Interest (POIs), such as a radio tower, transformer station, some hideouts, outposts, and houses. The POIs can offer valuable resources to help players upgrade their Shelter and reach its maximum level. Doing so will generate more materials and food to use, as well as reducing the crafting time for weapons and consumables."
