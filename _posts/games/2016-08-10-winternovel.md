Sveta is a young bank intern. She believes that there is no end to the cycle of monotony that has become her life; secretly wishing for change but is too depressed to find the motivation.

Vlad is an unsociable, devil-may-care freelancer without any respect for the status quo who prefers to work alone.

They find their lives turned upside-down when they are forced to work together on an urgent, high-profile project that could change the course of their careers.

Can they work together despite their differences? Will this relationship change their lives for the better?
