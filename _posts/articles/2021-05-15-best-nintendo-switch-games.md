**My favorite games list:**
{: #toc }

## System sellers

The games that sell the platform itself. Must have and must play ones.

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

{% include image path="zelda-breath-of-the-wild.jpg" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" link=true %}

I've heard a lot of revives who praise [Zelda](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch/) as a masterpiece. It was compared to Witcher, The Elder Scrolls, and other legends of RPG. And Zelda didn't look so at a first glance. My first thought was: "What is that? Just a casual RPG with a little bit of content, not advanced techniques and outdated graphics!". I was wrong. Yes, Zelda is not about graphics or complicated story/quests. It's about gameplay. You have so many abilities and freedom to do. Just give this game a chance. And choose your own play style.

### Animal Crossing: New Horizons

{% include image path="animal-crossing.jpg" alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" link=true %}

[Animal Crossing](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch/) is a game where you just live. The closest analog is The Sims. But Animal Crossing is much more kind and relax. The game time is tied to a real life time. Usually it's good to spend around an hour in one day, and return back tomorrow. The game always brings you some nice events. Kindness and peace - those two words characterize the game.

### Super Mario Odyssey

{% include image path="super-mario-odyssey.jpg" alt="Super Mario Odyssey" link=true %}

[Super Mario Odyssey](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/super-mario-odyssey-switch/) is a 3D platformer with cute graphics and a lot of gameplay possibilities. You will be able to transform yourself into a bullet, tank, dinosaur, etc. I personally do not like platforms, but this one is something good.




## Exclusives

Those games are exclusive to Nintendo. You just can't play them on PS4/Xbox/PC.


### Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition

{% include image path="xenoblade-chronicles.jpg" alt="Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition" link=true %}

[Xenoblade Chronicles](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-switch/) is one of the best jRPG ever. It's not in the system sellers list just because not everyone likes jRPG, and the game does not give you such amount of freedom as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.


### Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle

{% include image path="mario-plus-rabbits.jpg" alt="Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle" link=true %}

[Mario + Rabbids](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-plus-rabbids-kingdom-battle-switch/) is something similar to XCOM, but much better. Turn-based battle on a 3D field divided into squares. The game probably will not fit kid auditory since it requires thinking a lot.


### Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore

{% include image path="tokyo-mirage-sessions.jpg" alt="Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore" link=true %}

[Tokyo Mirage Sessions](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-switch/) was my entrance to the Persona franchise. I can't suggest the game to everyone: it has a specific turn-based battle system, pretty long gameplay, and some repetitiveness. But it's one of my strongest drugs. Don't pay attention to some childish setting, or too bright colors. The game is pretty serious. Advantage of the Mirage Sessions in front of Persona - it doesn't have micro time management, so it's pretty difficult to miss something in a story unintentionally.


### The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD

{% include image path="skyward-sword.jpg" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD" link=true %}

Not too many games use motion control as the main input method. [Skyward Sword](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-switch/) is one of them. The game was ported from Wii, where motion control was the only possibility for the game. And it was not very good. But Switch's reimplementation is good and fun. Motion helps you to live the game with deeper immersion.


### Paper Mario: The Origami King

{% include image path="paper-mario.jpg" alt="Paper Mario: The Origami King" link=true %}

[Paper Mario](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/paper-mario-the-origami-king-switch/) is another 3D platformer on this top. A bit more 2D, more cartoonish style. The disadvantage of the game is casual monsters fights - it's too easy. But the games still give a lot of holiday feeling.


### Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker

{% include image path="captain-toad.jpg" alt="Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker" link=true %}

[Captain Toad](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-switch/) is a good 3D action-puzzle on small maps. Especially perfect to play in portative mode with a touch screen.


### Monster Hunter: Rise

{% include image path="monster-hunter-rise.jpg" alt="Monster Hunter: Rise" link=true %}

[Monster Hunter](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/monster-hunter-rise-switch/) is a good RPG with a focus on a fight. The game is imbued with an Asian spirit.


### The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening

{% include image path="links-awakening.jpg" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening" link=true %}

[Link's Awakening](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-switch/) has nothing in common with Breath of the Wild. It's a clone of the original gameboy game, top-down view. The graphics is pretty cute.


### Fire Emblem: Three Houses

{% include image path="fire-emblem.jpg" alt="Fire Emblem: Three Houses" link=true %}

[Fire Emblem](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fire-emblem-three-houses-switch/) is a turn-based RPG with a battle similar to XCOM. You are a school teacher in the game. And you have to rise your classâ€™s students into high-class warriors who will be able to fight in the team.


### Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury

{% include image path="super-mario-3d-world.jpg" alt="Super Mario 3D World" link=true %}

[Super Mario 3D World](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/super-mario-3d-world-plus-bowsers-fury-switch/) is another Mario 3D platformer on this top. Yes, they are good on Switch. 



### Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity

{% include image path="hyrule-warriors-calamity.jpg" alt="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity" link=true %}

The fighting game in the mosou genre - it's where you are the alone warrior beat hundreds of enemies at the same time. The battles are pretty fun in [Hyrule Warriors](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-switch/).


### Pikmin 3 Deluxe

{% include image path="pikmin.jpg" alt="Pikmin 3 Deluxe" link=true %}

[Pikmin](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pikmin-3-deluxe-switch/) is a game similar to Overlord - you have a large band of s small creatures who follow you and executes your orders. Each creature type could do something unique: create fire, freeze water, move stones, etc. 


### Fitness Boxing 

{% include image path="fitness-boxing.jpg" alt="Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm & Exercise" link=true %}

[Fitness Boxing](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fitness-boxing-2-rhythm-and-exercise-switch/) is one of the rare sports games on Switch. Various kicks and jabs under some rhythmic music feel great.



## Multiple players and Party games

Those games are fun to play in a party mode: 2-4 players on the same console


### Super Mario Party

{% include image path="super-mario-party.jpg" alt="Super Mario Party" link=true %}

A collection of mini-games for 2-4 players. Puzzles, board games, rhythm games, etc. Plus a lot of games use the capabilities of Nintendo hardware - players will move physically and will enjoy it. Everything needed for a party could be found there. The best option for 4 players. Do you have the party at home? Just do the [Super Mario Party](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/super-mario-party-switch/).


### Mario Kart 8 Deluxe

{% include image path="mario-kart.jpg" alt="Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" link=true %}

The only party racing game for Switch. It has a cartoonish feeling and looks like a game for kids. But [Mario Kart](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-kart-8-deluxe-switch/) has its own pretty advanced physics and racing strategies. Totally recommended for 2-4 players. 


### Mario Tennis Aces

{% include image path="mario-tennis-aces.jpg" alt="Mario Tennis Aces" link=true %}

[Mario Tennis](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-tennis-aces-switch/) is a pretty good sports game for two players. The mechanics were new to our parties, so almost everyone was a beginner - it's fun to play on the same level.

### Mario Golf: Super Rush

{% include image path="mario-golf.jpg" alt="Mario Golf: Super Rush" link=true %}

The only true-golf simulator on Switch is a [Mario Golf](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-golf-super-rush-switch/). We like to play the game with my wife when we don't want to have adrenalin in the blood, but something calm and more strategic.


### Go Vacation

{% include image path="go-vacation.jpg" alt="Go Vacation" link=true %}

[Go Vacation](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/go-vacation-switch/) is something kinda similar to Mario Party - you have a lot of mini-games to play. But the activities in a Go Vacation are more close to the real-life ones: biking, hiking, volleyball, etc. It's really fun to play. The only disadvantage is graphics - the game comes from Nintendo Wii, so it looks kinda outdated nowadays.


### Castle Crashers Remastered

{% include image path="castle-crashers.jpg" alt="Castle Crashers Remastered" link=true %}

[Castle Crashers](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/castle-crashers-remastered-switch/) is a fun beatâ€™em up game up to 4 players. Doesn't feels like a battle or kill, it feels like pure fun.


## Other games with advantages on Switch

### Sniper Elite 4

{% include image path="sniper-elite-4.jpg" alt="Sniper Elite 4" link=true %}

It's totally not possible to play shooter games on other consoles when you got used to Switch's accelerometer aim helper. Also, the quality of vibration adds some drive to the game. It's pleasant to pull the trigger in [Sniper Elite](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sniper-elite-4-switch/) series.


### The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

{% include image path="the-witcher.jpg" alt="The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" link=true %}

[The Witcher](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-complete-edition-switch/) supports cross saves between Switch and Steam. Just take it on a trip with you and continue to play on PC at home.


### Hades

{% include image path="hades.jpg" alt="Hades" link=true %}

[Hades](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hades-switch/) is a god-like rogue-like dungeon crawler. Kill all the beasts! The game has cross saves same as The Witcher.





## Good games to play on Switch

The list of games available on other platforms too. But you don't need another platform, you could play them on Switch.



### Racing


#### Burnout Paradise Remastered

{% include image path="burnout.jpg" alt="Burnout Paradise Remastered" link=true %}

Arcade racing. No physics, no big goals, nothing serious. Just pure fun. Burn it out, [Burnout](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/burnout-paradise-remastered-switch/)!


#### CarX Drift Racing

{% include image path="carx-drift.jpg" alt="CarX Drift Racing" link=true %}

I absolutely like racing drift games from the tines of NFS: Underground. And [CarX Drift Racing](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/carx-drift-racing-online-switch/) is something that makes my heart beats faster. Each auto has its own personality. It wasn't easy to start and understand the physics. But a combination of good car, tuning, and track finally gave me the perfect pleasure.


#### GRID Autosport

{% include image path="grid.jpg" alt="GRID Autosport" link=true %}

[GRID Autosport](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/grid-autosport-switch/) is still an arcade. But it has some physics, so could be counted as the only racing simulator on Switch. The game is very special and I would recommend it only to the fans of the series. Or of hardcore real racing.


#### Absolute Drift

{% include image path="absolute-drift.jpg" alt="Absolute Drift" link=true %}

[Absolute Drift](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/absolute-drift-switch/) is a drifting game with a top view. You have to get used to physics. But the game is really one of the best when you do.


#### Lonely Mountains: Downhill

{% include image path="lonely-mountains.jpg" alt="Lonely Mountains: Downhill" link=true %}

[Lonely Mountains: Downhill](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/lonely-mountains-downhill-switch/) - Bicycling simulator. Pretty hardcore and fun one.


### RPG

#### Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin

{% include image path="monster-hunter-stories-2.jpg" alt="Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin" link=true %}

Monster Hunter Rise focuses on a battle. [Monster Hunter Stories](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-of-ruin-switch/) is more about the story than battle or the development of the character. It feels more like a good 3D visual novel. But the world is open, you ar able to travel freely.



#### Immortals Fenyx Rising

{% include image path="immortals-fenyx-rising.jpg" alt="Immortals Fenyx Rising" link=true %}

[Immortals Fenyx Rising](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/immortals-fenyx-rising-switch/) is a pretty good clone of Zelda from Ubisoft. Nice graphics, good character leveling system. A no NPC around at all - only enemies.


#### Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning

{% include image path="re-reckoning.jpg" alt="Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning" link=true %}

Per me, [Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/kingdoms-of-amalur-re-reckoning-switch/) is a mix of RPG and Slasher mechanics - you'll have to click and dodge all the opponents. It's pretty linear but really fun to play.



#### Ni no Kuni Wrath of the White Witch

{% include image path="ni-no-kuni.jpg" alt="Ni no Kuni Wrath of the White Witch" link=true %}

[Ni no Kuni](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-switch/) is an RPG developed in cooperation with Ghibli. Really the best anime style. And not so easy as it looks like.


#### Catherine: Full Body

{% include image path="catherine.jpg" alt="Catherine: Full Body" link=true %}

I'd suggest [Catherine](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/catherine-full-body-switch/) for fans of Atlus, developers of Persona series and Tokyo Mirage Sessions. Catherine is not something sexual-themed. It's traditional for Atlus great storyline about gods and demons.


#### Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster

{% include image path="smt3.jpg" alt="Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster" link=true %}

[Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/shin-megami-tensei-iii-nocturne-hd-remaster-switch/) is a remaster of a game from PlayStation 2. So it's really old school. Be ready to not have a mini-map or hints on every corner. The Persona series was born from Shin Megami Tensei, so it's nice to try the roots. The game is much darker. YOu can't satisfy everyone there (as in Persona). So bee ready to become the world-destroyer.


### Visual Novel

Nintendo Switch is something really perfect for playing visual novel games. You could play it on TV and enjoy better graphics, or take it with you to the bed and read it as an electronic book. But with graphics, music, and animations! And Nintendo's library is really rich for this type of games.


#### If My Heart Had Wings

{% include image path="if-my-heart-had-wings.jpg" alt="If My Heart Had Wings" link=true %}

Google for "best visual novels ever" and you'll find [If My Heart Had Wings](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/if-my-heart-had-wings-switch/) in the list. The plot caught me from the first lines. The graphics is pretty reach - the game is not most modern, so the characters are not Live2D-animated hare. But the backgrounds are really perfect and alive. But again, it's about the story.


#### Nekopara

{% include image path="nekopara.jpg" alt="Nekopara" link=true %}

[Nekopara](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/nekopara-vol4-switch/) is something opposite to If My Heart Had Wings - the story is very light here. The main thingie is the atmosphere. And the technical realization of cause - the novel uses all modern Live2D stuff, so try it to see _how_ modern visual novel could look like and feel like.


#### Doki Doki Literature Club

{% include image path="doki-doki.jpg" alt="Doki Doki Literature Club" link=true %}

Do you want some visual novel for adults? [Doki Doki](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-switch/) is your choise. Not because of nudes or alcohol. The game starts pretty cute and kawaii. But be ready for suicide ending.



### Action


#### Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag

{% include image path="assassins-creed-black-flag.jpg" alt="Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag" link=true %}

One of the best [Assassin's Creed](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/assassins-creed-the-rebel-collection-switch/) games available on Switch.


#### The Talos Principle

{% include image path="the-talos-principle.jpg" alt="The Talos Principle " link=true %}

It's more puzzle than action. Something similar to Portal. But some chambers are pretty difficult to pass without platforming/action skills. Also, [The Talos Principle](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-talos-principle-deluxe-edition-switch/) has a pretty philosophical plot.


### Platformer


#### Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition

{% include image path="ori.jpg" alt="Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition" link=true %}

Hardcore platformer with a hilarious story. [Ori](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ori-and-the-blind-forest-definitive-edition-switch/) will touch your soul.


#### Trine

{% include image path="trine3.jpg" alt="Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power" link=true %}

[Trine](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/trine-3-the-artifacts-of-power-switch/) is a good platformer with one unique gameplay element - you can switch your playing character on the flight. Knight, mage, or thief. Each has unique strengths and disadvantages.



### Other


#### Florence

{% include image path="florence.jpg" alt="Florence" link=true %}

[Florence](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/florence-switch/) is one of the best mobile visual novels. It covers the theme of relations between women and men. And helps to find strength after breaking up.


#### YouTube

{% include image path="youtube.jpg" alt="YouTube" link=true %}

[YouTube](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/youtube-switch/) is not a game. But I run it really frequently. Switch is very silent, always connected to the TV/monitor, always booted into the operating system. So it's no need to wait while PC boots for a dinner - just run YouTube on your Switch.



## Conclusion

Nintendo Switch games are usually not about high-end AAA graphics. There are not many fighting games. But you could find a lot of good kind games focused on the gameplay.
